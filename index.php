Because of the high probability of combinations that have no result AND the ability to add a custom message for each of those combinations -- this proof of concept would probably be best used as in distributor / internal sales [training] tool to explain things and redirect a customer to better solution.</p>
<h3><a href="example2.php">Example #2: Sequential</a></h3>
